### Install the database

By default, we use a MySQL Database (5.7), if you want to change for something else, you might need to change the Connector in "DataSourceFactory".

[Here is the link to download the MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html)

Once the server is installed, you have to create a schema named `contactapp` and run either the "PersonDaoTestCase" or the SQL script that you can find in the folder "filesToCreateTheDataBase".
